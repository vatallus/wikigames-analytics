Leverage this everywhere:

1 successful creator partnership = 100K reach
10 creators = 1M reach
Cost = $0 (give free access)

This is your #1 growth lever!
Priority: Email 100 creators THIS WEEK
```

### 4. MULTIPLE REVENUE = Safety
```
Don't rely on 1 source:
- Affiliate (quick money)

If one fails, others sustain you
```
